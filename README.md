## What is Botium

Selenium is the de-facto-standard for testing web applications. Appium is the de-facto-standard for testing smartphone applications. Botium is for testing conversational AI. Just as Selenium and Appium, Botium is free and Open Source, and available on Github.

# Documentation

See [here](https://botium-docs.readthedocs.io/) for Botium documentation.

## Connectors
Botium Core provides the core functionality. For attaching Botium to your chatbot, there are lots of _connectors_ available for most important chatbot technologies, frameworks, APIs, SDKs, cloud services etc. Sample configurations and scripts are included with each connector.

**All connectors are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/codeforequity-at?tab=repositories&q=botium-connector)**

See [here](https://wiki.botiumbox.com/technical-reference/botium-connectors/) for the latest connector updates.

## Installation Tracking
This module is sending anonymous installation information to our server (operating system, architecture, library version), which is used for making this project better. You can always disable this tracking by setting the environment variable _BOTIUM_ANALYTICS_ to _false_ before installing it.
